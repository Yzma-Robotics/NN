## A Neural Network From Scratch With Python

### Prerequisites
You must have Numpy (for math computations)

### Project Structure
Install [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), the only dependency, if you need to:

```bash
$ pip install numpy
```

Then, run it with no arguments:

```bash
$ python network.py
```
